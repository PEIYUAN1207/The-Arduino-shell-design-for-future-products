#1.0Shell
This is the complete housing for version 1.0.
This version's housing is integrated; the modeling components cannot be opened or disassembled.
If you're planning to 3D print this version, FDM printing is not suitable (it requires extensive support). Instead, we recommend using a stereolithography (SLA) technology.
