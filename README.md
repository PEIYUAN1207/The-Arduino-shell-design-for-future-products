# The-Arduino-shell-design-for-future-products
In the future, people are gonna have fewer emotional exchanges. So I designed a product to help people express their emotions. And its shell is the core part. 

[1.0 Shell](arduino(1).stl)
This is the first version of the complete enclosure; it's a single piece and more complex.
If you want to 3D print it, FDM is not recommended (it requires a lot of support and the print quality isn't great). You can use stereolithography (such as SLA)

[2.0 Shell](arduino(2).stl)
This is the second version of the shell, which has been simplified in appearance and made detachable to fit FDM printing.
However, its fitting parts are relatively thin and easy to break.

[3.0 Shell](arduino(3).stl)
This is the third version of the housing, an improvement on the second version. The interlocking structure has been optimized.
However, the interlocking portion is quite thick and needs to be polished or reduced in the file.

This is the drawing file for laser cutting cover, 4 can be cut at a time
